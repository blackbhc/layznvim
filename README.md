# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

A fork of the starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Refer to the official [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.

# There are some more plugins in my fork:
1. Copilot.vim: not the ["zbirenbaum/copilot.lua"](https://github.com/zbirenbaum/copilot.lua). (As I find for some unknown reason it's much more slower than the [official one](https://github.com/github/copilot.vim).)
2. [flazz/vim-colorschemes](https://github.com/flazz/vim-colorschemes): more colorthemes.
3. [EdenEast/nightfox.nvim](https://github.com/EdenEast/nightfox.nvim): another colorthemes family.
4. [ethanholz/nvim-lastplace](https://github.com/ethanholz/nvim-lastplace): open at the same position as last edit.
5. [kshenoy/vim-signature](https://github.com/kshenoy/vim-signature): visulize the book marks.
6. [andymass/vim-matchup](https://github.com/andymass/vim-matchup): extends vim's % key to language-specific (such as if-else) words instead of just single characters.
7. [sakhnik/nvim-gdb](https://github.com/sakhnik/nvim-gdb): an integration of gdb for neovim, which I prefer it than [nvim-dap](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap).
8. [HiPhish/nvim-ts-rainbow2](https://github.com/HiPhish/nvim-ts-rainbow2): rainbow brackets for neovim, 7 colors by default.
